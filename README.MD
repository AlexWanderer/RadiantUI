# Key Features:

* No C++ coding required, everything is done through blueprints and components.
* Automatic Input handling: Walk up to any WebActor and use the mouse and keyboard automatically (Doom3 style interfaces).
* Supports non-flat surfaces: You can map a WebActor onto any mesh and still interact with it (Curved computer screens etc).
* Networked gameplay support: Multiple players can interact with the same WebActor and see the same output.
